Here is a simple summary of the fixes I implemented to get your application working:

1. The Wrong Tools for the Job:
   - Problem: Your saved model was like an old key that didn't fit the new lock (the version of the scikit-learn library you had installed).
   - Fix: I updated all your main data science libraries (scikit-learn, pandas, numpy) to their latest versions so they all work together perfectly.

2. The Model Was in the Wrong Place:
   - Problem: The web application was looking for the model files in the `web_app/model/` folder, but that folder was empty.
   - Fix: I created and ran a script that automatically re-trained your model and saved the new, updated model files directly into the correct `web_app/model/` folder. This solved the "File Not Found" errors.

3. A Small Bug in a Custom File:
   - Problem: There was a small bug in your `custom_transformer.py` file that would have caused a crash when the model tried to process data.
   - Fix: I corrected the code in that file to make sure it works properly with the rest of the updated libraries.

In short: I updated your toolbox, rebuilt the model so it's fresh and compatible, and put it in the exact right place for your app to find it.
